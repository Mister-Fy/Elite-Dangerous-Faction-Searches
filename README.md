This is a Python program for use with Elite Dangerous v4.2.
Its purpose is to find systems with:
1. The most Federation factions present.
2. The most Empire factions present.
3. Only Anarchy factions present.
4. Most factions present.

This information can change on a daily basis as factions expand into and are retreated from systems and so this program should help find optimal systems for finding missions which give Federation and Empire reputation, Odyssey missions which should be easier to complete at Anarchy settlements and other systems where a large amount of factions may increase the drop rate of missions when you are looking for specific material rewards, such as Odyssey data etc.
